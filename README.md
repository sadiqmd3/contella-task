 >>>i have Builded  a user-friendly interface for a Centella tool that empowers researchers to visualize, analyze, and compare drug molecule data. This tool primary functionalities


> Visualizing Molecule Structures:-
> It will Display molecule structures in a clear and informative manner, potentially using 2D or
3D representations.
> Considering  libraries or tools specifically designed for chemical structure
visualization, such as  3Dmol.js
> It Enable users to interact with the structures, such as zooming, rotating, or highlighting
specific regions.


>>> We can Analyzing Molecule Properties:-

>>Molecular information-
    >>Molecule- 1
        >Molecule Name: protein structure of Ribonuclease
        >Model Type: pdb
        >Query: 1BRS

>>Molecule-2
    >Molecule Name: protein structure of Thymidylate kinase
    >Model Type: pdb
    >Query: 1TDP


>> Molecule-3
    >Molecular information
    >Molecule Name: Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)
    >Model Type: pdb
    >Query: 1DNA


>> The above molecules will b shown in dropdown in select molecule

>> for running the code use npm start in terminal 
>> i have also  made it responsive as well
