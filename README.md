# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

 >>>i have Builded  a user-friendly interface for a Centella tool that empowers researchers to visualize, analyze, and compare drug molecule data. This tool primary functionalities


> Visualizing Molecule Structures:-
> It will Display molecule structures in a clear and informative manner, potentially using 2D or
3D representations.
> Considering  libraries or tools specifically designed for chemical structure
visualization, such as  3Dmol.js
> It Enable users to interact with the structures, such as zooming, rotating, or highlighting
specific regions.


>>> We can Analyzing Molecule Properties:-

>>Molecular information-
    >>Molecule- 1
        >Molecule Name: protein structure of Ribonuclease
        >Model Type: pdb
        >Query: 1BRS

>>Molecule-2
    >Molecule Name: protein structure of Thymidylate kinase
    >Model Type: pdb
    >Query: 1TDP


>> Molecule-3
    >Molecular information
    >Molecule Name: Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA)
    >Model Type: pdb
    >Query: 1DNA


>> The above molecules will b shown in dropdown in select molecule

>> for running the code use npm start in terminal 
>> i have also  made it responsive as well
